    <p>The portfolio page has multiple aspects but one primary integration<br><br>The portfolio page examples are dynamically created by leveraging XMLHttpRequest object
    to call a JSON file from github within my own repository. Once successfully recieved the js will parse the xml and dynamically create the HTML which is then inserted into index.html portfolio section.  If the "example" is not live yet, it will create alternate html for it stating that the example is "Coming Soon". 
    </p>
    In addition, another html file was created for the resume and the main index.html will redirect a user to that page which, in turn, allows the user to navigate back to the original page.

## Future Opportunities
<ol type="1">
    <li>Style the resume page</li>
    <li>Create administrative page to add portfolio examples that ultimately populates the examples in the Portfolio page</li>
    <li>Allow a user to drag/drop the examples within the main page</li>
</ol>
